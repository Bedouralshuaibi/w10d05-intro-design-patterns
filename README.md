## Introduction

In this exercise, we'll learn the basics of design patterns — the underlying rules and customs that define how we build a lot of software. It's an admittedly heavy concept, so let's try to make it as simple as possible.

### What's a Design Pattern, Anyway?

To start, let's work through the myGA lesson on design patterns. Take 15–20 minutes to complete the lesson.

When you're done, let's recap:

- Explain it to me like I'm 5: What's a design pattern?
- How do design patterns compare to the frameworks and structures we use as developers?
- What are the three categories of design patterns?
- What questions do you still have?

## Exploring the Patterns

Let's look at some of the most famous design patterns and see how they work.

Get into pairs and choose one of the following to research:

- MVC
- Singleton
- Decorator
- Factory
- Observer
- Command
- Iterator

You should be able to answer these questions:

- How does this design pattern work?
- Why do we use it? What benefits does it provide?

Take 20 minutes to do some research. Be prepared to share your findings with the class.
